# John Conway's Game of Life
I've never really looked at implementing the game of life, and thought I'd take a look at it for fun/to get myself a little better acquainted with JavaFX. I'm following along with a yotube video series you can find [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncRA1OAbMmk).

Right now, the ui is hideous, and only works when run through maven (at least with my configuration). Given time, that should change.
