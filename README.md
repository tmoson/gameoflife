# John Conway's Game of Life
I've never really looked at implementing the game of life, and thought I'd take a look at it for fun/to get myself a little better acquainted with JavaFX. I'm following along with a youtube video series you can find [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncRA1OAbMmk).

After a few videos, I went and did my own thing. Not sure I'll be coming back to this, as I've looked at the bits I'm interested in. This isn't the best engineered project by a long shot, but the videos were getting into what I felt were over-engineering. If I get more interested in optimizing anything, I might pick this back up.
